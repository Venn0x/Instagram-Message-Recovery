# Instagram-Message-Recovery
Instagram message reader &amp; recovery (in some cases)

To use, request the data on instagram in settings, and after you receive the arhive find the messages.json file.

Upload the source code to a host / localhost (xampp, lampp) and the messages.json file and specify the link to file in the index page and the instagram name

Everything happens locally, so no message spying

If messages.json and your name is valid, a list with all the conversations will appear. Clicking on one will go into that conversation (from the start)
